    "## 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_example](./img/data.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable **qndata.stocks.load_ndx_data(tail=period)** is an xarray.DataArray structure which contains historical market data for the last (tail=period) days and whose coordinates are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **time**: a date in format yyyy-mm-dd;\n",
    "* **field**: an attribute, for example the opening daily price;\n",
    "* **asset**: the identifying symbol for the asset, for example NAS:APPL for Apple.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on xarray can be found at https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Strategy. Weights allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![weights_example](./img/weights.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each date, the algorithm calculates the portfolio weights which should be used at the opening of the next day's trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantiacs uses an exposure-based backtester. The trading algorithm should define the fractions of capital which will be distributed to the assets (allocation weights). A **positive** weight means a long position (**buy**), a **negative** value means a short position (**sell**).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that algorithm decisions can use all data available at the close of the session, and will be applied at the opening of the next day's session. The chosen allocation weights are translated to positions (number of contracts to be bought/sold) immediately after the close of the session and transactions are executed at the open of the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performance estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "![statistic_example](./img/statistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have built the algorithm, we can evaluate its performance calculating statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can display the values of statistical indicators on a cumulative basis, assuming that we have 1M USD at the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call will produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **equity**: the cumulative value of profits and losses since inception (1M USD);\n",
    "* **relative_return**: the relative daily variation of **equity**;\n",
    "* **volatility**: the volatility of the investment since inception (i.e. the annualized standard deviation of the daily returns);\n",
    "* **underwater**: the time evolution of drawdowns;\n",
    "* **max_drawdown**: the absolute minimum of the underwater chart;\n",
    "* **sharpe_ratio**: the annualized Sharpe ratio since inception; the value must be larger than 1 for taking part to contests;\n",
    "* **mean_return**: the annualized mean return of the investment since inception;\n",
    "* **bias**: the daily asymmetry between long and short exposure: 1 for a long-only system, -1 for a short-only one;\n",
    "* **instruments**: the number of instruments which get allocations on a given day;\n",
    "* **avg_turnover**: the average turnover;\n",
    "* **avg_holding_time**: the average holding time in days.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed explanation can be found inspecting the source code for the library in your directory at **/qnt/stats.py**\n",
